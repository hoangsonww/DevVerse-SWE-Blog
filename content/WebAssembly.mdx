## 3. Architecture and Core Concepts

Understanding the underlying architecture of WebAssembly is key to leveraging its power. Here, we explore the core components and concepts that define Wasm.

### 3.1 Modules

- **Definition:**
  A WebAssembly module is the fundamental unit of deployment. It contains compiled code, definitions for functions, memory, tables, and other resources.

- **Structure:**
  Modules are organized into sections (such as type, import, function, memory, and export sections) that define how the module behaves and interacts with its environment.

### 3.2 Linear Memory

- **Concept:**
  WebAssembly uses a single, contiguous block of memory known as linear memory. This memory is separate from the JavaScript heap and is managed explicitly by the module.

- **Dynamic Resizing:**
  Linear memory can be dynamically grown at runtime, allowing applications to allocate more memory as needed while ensuring efficient data access.

### 3.3 Import and Export Mechanisms

- **Interoperability:**
  WebAssembly modules can import functions, memory, and other objects from the host environment (typically JavaScript) and can also export their own functions for external use.

- **Two-Way Communication:**
  This import/export mechanism enables tight integration between WebAssembly and JavaScript, allowing developers to offload compute-intensive tasks to Wasm while managing application logic in JavaScript.

### 3.4 Execution Environment

- **Sandboxing:**
  Wasm code runs within a secure, sandboxed environment, ensuring that it has no direct access to system resources. This design minimizes security risks and prevents malicious behavior.

- **Just-In-Time Compilation:**
  Modern browsers use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation techniques to convert WebAssembly into optimized machine code on the fly, providing high-performance execution.

  Fetch and instantiate the WebAssembly module in the browser using JavaScript.

- **Invocation:**
  Call exported WebAssembly functions directly from JavaScript, offloading heavy computations while maintaining overall application control in JavaScript.

### 5.2 Example: Integrating a Simple WebAssembly Module

Imagine a simple function that adds two numbers, written in C:

```c
// add.c
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

After compiling this code with a tool like Emscripten, you can load and use it in JavaScript as follows:

```javascript
async function loadWasm() {
  // Fetch the compiled WebAssembly binary
  const response = await fetch('add.wasm');
  const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();

  // Instantiate the WebAssembly module
  const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiate(buffer);

  // Use the exported add function
  console.log('2 + 3 =', instance.exports._add(2, 3));
}

loadWasm();
```

This example demonstrates the seamless interaction between JavaScript and WebAssembly, leveraging Wasm’s performance benefits while using familiar JavaScript workflows.
