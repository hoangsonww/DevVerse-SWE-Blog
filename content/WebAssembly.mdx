## 3. Architecture and Core Concepts

Understanding the underlying architecture of WebAssembly is key to leveraging its power. Here, we explore the core components and concepts that define Wasm.

### 3.1 Modules

- **Definition:**
  A WebAssembly module is the fundamental unit of deployment. It contains compiled code, definitions for functions, memory, tables, and other resources.

- **Structure:**
  Modules are organized into sections (such as type, import, function, memory, and export sections) that define how the module behaves and interacts with its environment.

### 3.2 Linear Memory

- **Concept:**
  WebAssembly uses a single, contiguous block of memory known as linear memory. This memory is separate from the JavaScript heap and is managed explicitly by the module.

- **Dynamic Resizing:**
  Linear memory can be dynamically grown at runtime, allowing applications to allocate more memory as needed while ensuring efficient data access.

### 3.3 Import and Export Mechanisms

- **Interoperability:**
  WebAssembly modules can import functions, memory, and other objects from the host environment (typically JavaScript) and can also export their own functions for external use.

- **Two-Way Communication:**
  This import/export mechanism enables tight integration between WebAssembly and JavaScript, allowing developers to offload compute-intensive tasks to Wasm while managing application logic in JavaScript.

### 3.4 Execution Environment

- **Sandboxing:**
  Wasm code runs within a secure, sandboxed environment, ensuring that it has no direct access to system resources. This design minimizes security risks and prevents malicious behavior.

- **Just-In-Time Compilation:**
  Modern browsers use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation techniques to convert WebAssembly into optimized machine code on the fly, providing high-performance execution.

## 5. Integration with JavaScript

One of the most powerful aspects of WebAssembly is its ability to work alongside JavaScript. This section details how developers can integrate Wasm into their existing JavaScript applications.

### 5.1 Typical Workflow

- **Development:**
  Write performance-critical code in a language like C, C++, or Rust.

- **Compilation:**
  Use tools such as Emscripten or Rust’s `wasm-pack` to compile the code into a WebAssembly module.

- **Loading:**
  Fetch and instantiate the WebAssembly module in the browser using JavaScript.

- **Invocation:**
  Call exported WebAssembly functions directly from JavaScript, offloading heavy computations while maintaining overall application control in JavaScript.

### 5.2 Example: Integrating a Simple WebAssembly Module

Imagine a simple function that adds two numbers, written in C:

```c
// add.c
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

After compiling this code with a tool like Emscripten, you can load and use it in JavaScript as follows:

```javascript
async function loadWasm() {
  // Fetch the compiled WebAssembly binary
  const response = await fetch("add.wasm");
  const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();

  // Instantiate the WebAssembly module
  const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiate(buffer);

  // Use the exported add function
  console.log("2 + 3 =", instance.exports._add(2, 3));
}

loadWasm();
```

This example demonstrates the seamless interaction between JavaScript and WebAssembly, leveraging Wasm’s performance benefits while using familiar JavaScript workflows.
