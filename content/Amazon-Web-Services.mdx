## 3. Core AWS Services

AWS offers hundreds of services. Here we focus on the core categories:

### 3.1 Compute Services

- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**
  Provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Use EC2 to launch virtual servers (instances) and configure them to suit your needs.

**Example Use Case:** Hosting web servers, running batch processing jobs, or supporting high-performance computing.

- **AWS Lambda:**
  A serverless computing service that runs code in response to events. You pay only for the compute time you consume.

**Example Use Case:** Real-time file processing, data transformation, and backend services without managing servers.

- **Amazon ECS and EKS:**
  Container services that let you run Docker containers. ECS is AWS’s native service, while EKS provides managed Kubernetes.

### 3.2 Storage Services

- **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
  An object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, and security.

**Example Use Case:** Storing backup files, static website hosting, or data lakes for big data analytics.

- **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store):**
  Provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.

**Example Use Case:** Persistent storage for databases or applications running on EC2.

- **Amazon Glacier:**
  Low-cost archival storage designed for data that is infrequently accessed.

### 3.3 Database Services

- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):**
  A managed service for relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

**Example Use Case:** Running web applications that require a relational database without the hassle of database administration.

- **Amazon DynamoDB:**
  A fully managed NoSQL database service offering fast and predictable performance.

**Example Use Case:** Applications with high throughput requirements, such as gaming or real-time bidding platforms.

- **Amazon Aurora:**
  A high-performance, MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database.

### 3.4 Networking and Content Delivery

- **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**
  Enables you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated network.

**Example Use Case:** Creating secure network environments for sensitive applications.

- **Amazon CloudFront:**
  A content delivery network (CDN) that securely delivers data, videos, and applications to users globally.

**Example Use Case:** Reducing latency for website users across different regions.

- **Amazon Route 53:**
  A scalable Domain Name System (DNS) service that routes end users to internet applications.

### 3.5 Security, Identity, and Compliance

- **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):**
  Controls access to AWS services and resources securely.

**Example Use Case:** Defining user roles and permissions for a large team.

- **AWS KMS (Key Management Service):**
  Manages encryption keys used to secure your data.

**Example Use Case:** Encrypting sensitive data stored in S3 or RDS.

- **AWS CloudTrail:**
  Provides logging and monitoring of account activity across your AWS infrastructure.

### 3.6 DevOps and Management Tools

- **AWS CloudFormation:**
  Automates the deployment of AWS resources using templates.

**Example Use Case:** Creating and managing infrastructure as code.

- **Amazon CloudWatch:**
  Monitors AWS resources and applications in real-time.

**Example Use Case:** Setting alarms and dashboards to track performance and health.

- **AWS CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild:**
  Provide services to automate application deployments, continuous integration, and continuous delivery.

### 3.7 Other Noteworthy Services

- **Machine Learning and AI:**
  Services like Amazon SageMaker, Rekognition, and Comprehend enable machine learning model building, image recognition, and natural language processing.
- **Analytics:**
  Tools such as Amazon Redshift, Athena, and EMR support big data processing and analysis.
- **Internet of Things (IoT):**
  AWS IoT Core helps connect and manage devices at scale.

## 4. AWS Global Infrastructure and Architecture

### Global Network of Data Centers

AWS operates in multiple **Regions** around the globe. Each Region contains multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)**—physically separated data centers that offer redundancy and high availability. Additionally, AWS has numerous **Edge Locations** for content delivery via CloudFront.

### Designing Resilient Architectures

- **High Availability:**
  Distribute applications across multiple AZs to protect against individual data center failures.
- **Scalability:**
  Use services like Auto Scaling for EC2 to automatically adjust capacity based on demand.
- **Fault Tolerance:**
  Implement strategies like load balancing, redundancy, and backup solutions to ensure continuous operation.

### Deployment Strategies

- **Serverless Architectures:**
  Build applications using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and managed databases for a fully serverless environment.
- **Containerization:**
  Deploy applications using Docker containers orchestrated by Amazon ECS or EKS.
- **Microservices:**
  Break applications into small, independent services that communicate via APIs.

## 5. AWS Security Best Practices

### Shared Responsibility Model

AWS operates under a shared responsibility model:

- **AWS's Responsibility:**
  Security of the cloud (hardware, software, networking, and facilities).
- **Customer's Responsibility:**
  Security in the cloud (data, identity, application-level controls).

### Security Tools and Techniques

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
  Use IAM roles, policies, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to secure access.
- **Encryption:**

## 6. Cost Optimization Strategies

AWS offers flexible pricing models, but cost control requires careful planning:

- **Pay-as-You-Go:**
  Only pay for the services you use.
- **Reserved Instances and Savings Plans:**
  Commit to a usage level for a lower hourly rate.
- **Spot Instances:**
  Utilize spare capacity at a discount, ideal for fault-tolerant workloads.
- **Cost Management Tools:**
  Use AWS Cost Explorer, Budgets, and Trusted Advisor to monitor and optimize spending.
