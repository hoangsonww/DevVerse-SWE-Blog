# Microfrontends Architecture

### Author: Son Nguyen

> Date: 2024-07-30

Microfrontend architecture is an approach where a frontend application is decomposed into individual, semi-independent ‚Äúmicroapps‚Äù that work together to form a cohesive user experience. Inspired by the principles of microservices on the backend, this design pattern promotes team autonomy, independent deployment, and flexible technology choices. In this guide, we explore the fundamentals of microfrontends, examine their benefits, discuss various techniques to implement them, and outline best practices for creating scalable, maintainable, and resilient frontend systems.

## I. Introduction to Microfrontends

As web applications grow in complexity and size, maintaining a single, monolithic frontend codebase becomes increasingly challenging. Microfrontend architecture addresses these challenges by breaking the frontend into smaller, self-contained modules‚Äîeach responsible for a specific business domain or feature.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Decomposition:** Breaking down the monolithic frontend into ‚Äúmicroapps‚Äù that focus on specific functionalities.
- **Independence:** Each microapp can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, often by autonomous cross-functional teams.
- **Team Autonomy:** Different teams can choose different technology stacks based on their specific needs, without affecting the entire system.
- **Scalability & Maintainability:** Smaller codebases are easier to manage, update, and scale, leading to faster iteration cycles and improved long-term maintainability.

---

## II. Benefits of Microfrontend Architecture

Microfrontends offer a range of significant benefits compared to monolithic frontends:

### 1. Independent Technology Choices

- **Flexibility:** Teams can choose the best framework or library (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) that suits their microapp‚Äôs requirements.
- **Modernization:** Legacy parts of an application can be incrementally rewritten using modern technologies without a complete overhaul.

### 2. Faster Development and Deployment

- **Parallel Development:** Multiple teams can work on different microapps simultaneously, reducing inter-team dependencies.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Smaller, isolated modules allow for frequent, independent deployments, which accelerates the release cycle.

### 3. Improved Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Focused Testing:** Each microapp can have its own dedicated testing suite, making it easier to isolate and fix issues.
- **Resilience:** Failures or bugs in one microapp do not impact the entire application, leading to a more resilient overall system.

### 4. Enhanced Scalability and Maintainability

- **Modular Growth:** New features can be added as new microapps, scaling the application organically.
- **Simplified Maintenance:** Smaller codebases reduce the cognitive load on developers, leading to easier maintenance and quicker feature enhancements.

## III. History and Evolution of Microfrontends

The evolution of microfrontends mirrors that of microservices on the backend. Initially, frontend applications were developed as monolithic entities, which became unwieldy as user interfaces grew in complexity. The need for decoupled, independently deployable frontend modules led to early experiments in modularization. These experiments paved the way for modern microfrontend practices:

- **Early Experiments:** Initially, developers tried to break monoliths using iframes or embedded components.
- **Modern Approaches:** With the advent of sophisticated module bundlers and dynamic import techniques, modern solutions such as Webpack Module Federation and Single-SPA have emerged.
- **Community Adoption:** Organizations like Spotify, Zalando, and IKEA have publicly shared their experiences, driving the adoption and maturation of microfrontend architectures.

## IV. Why Microfrontends Matter

In today's dynamic digital landscape, user experiences must be fast, responsive, and continuously evolving. Monolithic frontends often hinder innovation due to their inherent complexity and interdependencies. Microfrontend architecture matters because it enables:

- **Team Autonomy and Ownership:** Each microapp is owned by a dedicated team, fostering innovation and accountability.
- **Rapid Iteration:** Smaller modules lead to quicker development cycles and faster feedback loops.
- **Technology Agnosticism:** Teams can adopt new technologies without being locked into a single tech stack.
- **Resilience:** Isolated failures are contained within individual microapps, preventing system-wide outages.
- **User-Centric Design:** Independent teams can tailor features to specific user needs, resulting in a more personalized experience.

---

## V. How Microfrontends Work

Microfrontend architecture employs several strategies to ensure that independently developed modules can seamlessly integrate into a cohesive application:

### 1. Technology Independence

- **Decoupled Builds:** Each microapp is built independently and may use its own build tools, frameworks, and libraries.
- **Versioning:** Teams manage versions separately, enabling incremental updates without breaking the entire system.

### 2. Code Isolation

- **Encapsulation:** Use techniques like the Shadow DOM, module scopes, or iframes to ensure that each microapp‚Äôs styles and scripts do not conflict with others.
- **Namespace Conventions:** Adopt naming conventions (e.g., team-specific prefixes) to avoid clashes in global variables, CSS classes, or storage keys.

### 3. Integration Strategies

- **Dynamic Imports:** Load microapps on-demand using dynamic imports in modern JavaScript.
- **Routing:** A shell or container application handles global routing and delegates specific URL segments to corresponding microapps.
- **Event-Based Communication:** Use custom events or shared state management libraries to allow microapps to communicate while remaining loosely coupled.

## VI. Techniques for Implementing Microfrontends

There are several approaches to building microfrontend architectures. Each technique comes with its own set of advantages and challenges.

### 1. Webpack Module Federation

Webpack Module Federation is a cutting-edge feature that enables separate builds to dynamically load code from each other. This approach minimizes duplication of shared dependencies and allows for seamless integration of independently deployed microapps.

**Example Webpack Configuration:**

```js
// webpack.config.js (for a microapp)
module.exports = {
  // ...other configuration settings
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: "microapp",
      filename: "remoteEntry.js",
      exposes: {
        "./Component": "./src/Component",
      },
      remotes: {
        shell: "shell@https://your-domain.com/remoteEntry.js",
      },
      shared: { react: { singleton: true }, "react-dom": { singleton: true } },
    }),
  ],
};
```

**Benefits:**

- No need for a complete re-architecture.
- Efficient dependency sharing.

### 2. Iframes

Iframes provide strong isolation by embedding an entire application within a parent page. This method is especially useful when complete encapsulation is necessary.

**Simple Iframe Example:**

```html
<iframe
  src="https://childapp.com"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  title="Child Application"
></iframe>
```

**Pros & Cons:**

- **Pros:** Excellent isolation, strong security boundaries.
- **Cons:** SEO challenges and potential performance overhead.

### 3. Reverse Proxy with NGINX

NGINX can be used as a reverse proxy to route requests to different microapps based on URL paths. This approach centralizes routing at the server level.

**Sample NGINX Configuration:**

```nginx
worker_processes 4;
events { worker_connections 1024; }

http {
  server {
    listen 80;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    location /users {
      try_files $uri /users/index.html;
    }
    location /customers {
      try_files $uri /customers/index.html;
    }
    location /admins {
      try_files $uri /admins/index.html;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Web Components

Web Components enable the creation of encapsulated, reusable custom elements that can be used in any framework or library. The Shadow DOM provides style isolation, ensuring that component styles do not leak into the global scope.

**Basic Custom Element Example:**

```js
class MyIcon extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
  }
  connectedCallback() {
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `<span>üå∏</span>`;
  }
}
customElements.define("my-icon", MyIcon);
```

**Usage in HTML:**

```html
<my-icon></my-icon>
```

### 5. Component Libraries for React/Vue

Develop microapps as libraries (npm packages) and integrate them into a container application via dynamic imports. This enables teams to develop and version their components independently.

**Example in React:**

```jsx
import Customers from "customers-library";

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <Customers />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 6. Monorepos

A monorepo houses multiple projects within a single repository, facilitating unified dependency management, code sharing, and consistent development practices. Tools like Lerna or Yarn Workspaces are commonly used in monorepo setups.

**Advantages:**

- Simplified dependency management.
- Easier cross-project refactoring.
- Atomic commits across microapps.

### 7. Single-SPA and Similar Frameworks

Single-SPA orchestrates multiple microapps on a single page by defining lifecycle methods (bootstrap, mount, unmount) for each module. This approach supports lazy loading and independent deployment.

**Core Concepts:**

- **Root Config:** Manages microapp registration and routing.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Each microapp defines its own lifecycle functions.
- **Lazy Loading:** Load microapps on demand to optimize performance.

### 8. Custom Orchestrators

Some organizations build custom orchestrators tailored to their unique needs. These orchestrators dynamically load and manage microapps based on user context, roles, or device type. Custom solutions can offer optimized performance and specialized features that off-the-shelf tools might not support.

## VII. Best Practices and Strategies for Scaling Microfrontends

### 1. Standardize UI/UX Guidelines

- **Design Systems:** Develop a shared style guide or design system (e.g., Material Design) to ensure consistency across microapps.
- **Component Libraries:** Share common UI components across teams to reduce duplication and maintain uniformity.

### 2. Define Clear Boundaries

- **Domain-Driven Design:** Align microapps with business domains to ensure clear separation of concerns.
- **API Contracts:** Define clear interfaces for communication between microapps, reducing interdependencies.

### 3. Ensure Loose Coupling

- **Independent Deployment:** Avoid shared runtime dependencies as much as possible to allow microapps to be deployed independently.
- **Communication Protocols:** Use event buses or custom events for inter-microapp communication while maintaining isolation.

### 4. Embrace Continuous Integration and Deployment

- **Automated Testing:** Implement robust testing pipelines for each microapp.
- **Deployment Pipelines:** Use CI/CD tools to streamline independent deployments, ensuring quick rollbacks if issues occur.

### 5. Monitor and Optimize Performance

- **Analytics:** Monitor load times, resource usage, and user interactions for each microapp.
- **Performance Budget:** Establish performance budgets to ensure that microapps remain fast and responsive even as they grow.
